MODEL OUTPUTS:

1) Decision Tree model:
    Mean:  4.277735710020492
    Standard deviation:  0.7801593021164924

2) Linear Regression model:
    Mean:  5.037482786117751
    Standard deviation:  1.0594382405606955

Note:- Linear regression is greater than decision tree
and obviously decision Tree model is better than linear regression model

We can try out any models of ML
